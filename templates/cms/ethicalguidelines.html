        <h1 class="entry-title">Biites ethical guidelines and conditions</h1>
  
        <div class="entry-content">
  <p>Our mission is to serve consumers a broad range of videos that are high-quality, entertaining, and authentic. To achieve this standard we ask our partners to follow the guidelines below.</p>
  <p><strong>1. GENERAL GUIDELINES</strong><br>
  <strong>1.1</strong> Biites is a video platform dedicated to commercially developed and sponsored films and videos. This includes native advertising videos, branded content videos and sponsored shows (also known as AFP formats: advertiser-funded programmes). All videos and films on Biites have one or more commercial ’sponsors’. They are clearly identified next to all films.</p>
  <p><strong>1.2</strong> Biites is a platform developed for longer video formats and series of videos. The common denominator for them all is that they have a narrative or an entertainment element, e.g. documentaries, series, debate shows, reports or entertainment films.</p>
  <p><strong>1.3</strong> The content of the videos must adhere to all relevant legislation, including legislation pertaining to marketing, e-commerce, and personal data as well as specific legislation concerning specific areas of business. The responsibility for this falls on the owner and sponsor of the film and video content. As a Biites customer you understand and accept that you are solely responsible for your content and the consequences of publishing it on Biites. Biites in no way supports or endorses content, opinions, recommendations or advice shared in the content. Furthermore, Biites denies any responsibility related to the content of all videos and films on the platform.</p>
  <p><strong>1.4</strong> If Biites becomes aware of any potential violation of our terms and conditions, we reserve the right to remove videos and films, according to our general terms and conditions.</p>
  <p><strong>1.5</strong> At the start of all videos or movies, it must be clearly stated who is sponsoring and submitting the video content. This can be done, for example, by clearly using logos identifying the parties involved or as prescribed by the applicable Ombudsman legislation and practices.</p>
  <p><strong>2. ETHICAL GUIDELINES</strong><br>
  The content of videos and films on Biites must not be offensive and must be ethically sound. Therefore, we have adopted the following guidelines for prohibited and limited content.<br>

Videos or movies that do not comply with our guidelines will be removed from the site and the commercial sender may be excluded from showing videos or movies on Biites.
